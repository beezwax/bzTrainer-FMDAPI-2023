# Beezwax FileMaker Data API Demo 2023
packaged as bzTrainer-FMDAPI-2023

## Introduction
Get started exploring FileMaker's Data API (DAPI) using REST and cURL.

This is a simple tutorial file designed to help you get started in your understanding of FileMaker 2023’s Data API and cURL options.

This file sends REST requests to itself, and works as a demo and tutorial for FM's DAPI functionality. Check out the scripts, especially `execute rest request` and study the results of requests as they appear in the fields on the right side of the UI.

This file also introduces the `Execute FileMaker Data API` script step. Check out `execute data api` as an alternative way to query the Data API.
